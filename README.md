A journey into indie game development 

🕹️ About the Game
Russian Roulette is a high-stakes, single-player psychological game where survival is a coin toss... with a revolver.
Play smart, spin the chamber, and see if fate smiles—or pulls the trigger.

This isn't about luck. It's about how far you're willing to go when the stakes are life and death.
Win, and live to play another round. Lose, and the game ends—permanently.
Welcome to the ultimate test of nerves, wit, and possibly very bad decision-making.
